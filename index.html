            Every necklace in our shop is carefully handmade and full of
            delicate designs. We deliberately check each and every piece before
            selling them to make sure there are no sharp edges. Our handcrafted
            jewelry has a sea glass core for every piece, the sea glass is
            carefully wrapped in strong sturdy wire and finally attached to a
            small chain or ribbon. These finely crafted jewels are sure to bring
            a smile to whoever may receive them. If you are interested, click
            the image of the necklace and it will take you to our etsy shop in a
            new tab.
